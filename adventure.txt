You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully.
You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a rocky bed.
The road, which approaches from the east, ends here amid the trees.
The forest thins out here to reveal a steep cliff.  There is no way down, but a small ledge can be seen to the west across the chasm.
At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed leads into the depression.
You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light at the east end of the passage.
You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".
You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit from east and west sides of the chamber.
At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
The crack is far too small for you to follow.  At its widest it is
barely wide enough to admit your foot.
You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
"You won't get it up the steps".
You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
directions.
You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
You didn't make it.
The dome is unclimbable.
You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in
the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
You are in a low n/s passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
down to an e/w passage.
You are in the south side chamber.
You are in the west side chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
A passage continues west and up here.
You can't get by the snake.
You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
a rock in the room's center.
You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
west.
You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
enters and exits through tiny slits.
You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
of the Hall of Mists.
You are at the west end of the Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl
continues west and another goes north.  To the south is a little
passage 6 feet off the floor.

up.  The maze continues at this level.
Dead end
You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
of the Hall of Mists.
You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
round two foot hole slants down.
You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
You are at a crossover of a high n/s passage and a low e/w one.
Dead end
You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
go west, east, ne, and nw.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
bedrock block.
You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were
large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
around the boulders.
You are in a secret n/s canyon above a large room.
You are in a secret n/s canyon above a sizable passage.
You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
north, south, and se.  The north one is as tall as the other two

You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, se, and sw.
Dead end crawl.
You are in a secret canyon which here runs e/w.  It crosses over a
very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
to get back up.
You are at a wide place in a very tight n/s canyon.
The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
You are in a tall e/w canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
seems to open up.

You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
profusion of leaves.
There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
passage leading back to the north.
You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].
The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
passage leads se, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.
You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
exits to the south and west.
You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen after a short
distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads ne.
You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.
A sign in midair here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.
Proceed at own risk.  [Witt Construction Company]"
You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *ALL* directions.
You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.
Dead end
You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A notice nearby reads: "Do
not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, "Treasure Vault.
Keys in main office."
You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A sw path leads away
from the chasm into a winding corridor.
You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
directions.
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads away from the
chasm on this side.
You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
heard in the distance.
The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
a low rumbling.
You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
oddly shaped limestone formations.
You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A notice
above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.

You are walking across the bottom of the reservoir.  Walls of water
rear up on either side.  The roar of the water cascading past is
